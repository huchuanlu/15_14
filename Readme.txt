run "demo_AR_Test_Linear" for testing the KCR method with linear kernel.
run "demo_AR_Test_LBPHK"  for testing the KCR method with LBP features and Hamming Kernel.

These codes have been tested on windows systerm, Matlab 2009B,32bit.
Note that these codes merely provide the basic implementation, the kernel matrix for the 
training data can be per-calculated to speed up the algorithm. 

Here, we merely provide a subset of AR database. The original database can be downloaded
